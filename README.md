<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Easy to Use: No setup required. It only takes one command to get weather report
* Lag Free: We ensure that there is always enough capacity for every server to get the highest quality possible
* Stable: Noob Tech Bot will always be available whenever you need to know the weather outside
* Credible: We always retrieves data from most trustworthy weather data collectors

### Built With

* [Surge](https://surge.sh/)
